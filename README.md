## Project Overview
This project-based examination consists of three parts that demonstrate skills in data preprocessing, machine learning, process mining, web scraping, and natural language processing. The project contributes 30% to the final grade and is evaluated based on five milestones.

## Project Structure

### Part A: Data Preprocessing and Prediction Models (30 Marks)
1. **Data Preprocessing (10 Marks)**
   - Preprocess the "Bike_Sales.xlsx" dataset
   - Remove missing data and outliers
   - Save transformed dataset as "Bukirwa.xlsx"

2. **Age Group Classification Model (10 Marks)**
   - Generate a machine learning model to classify "Age_Group"
   - Save the model as "age_predictor.joblib" or "age_predictor.pkl"

3. **Revenue Prediction Model (10 Marks)**
   - Create a machine learning model to predict "Revenue"
   - Use transformed dataset as training data
   - Test on "Bike_sales_Uganda.xlsx"
   - Save model as "Revenue_predictor"
   - Save predictions as "Revenue_prediction.csv"

### Part B: Advanced Modeling and Process Mining (40 Marks)
1. **Abalone Age Prediction (15 Marks)**
   - Generate a machine learning model to predict Abalone age
   - Apply model to predict ages in "Test.csv"

2. **Healthcare Process Mining (25 Marks)**
   - Generate event logs from "PatientReviews.csv"
   - Create visualizations of hospital actions (Jan-Jun 2017)
   - Apply process mining algorithms to show action flows

### Part C: Web Scraping and NLP (30 Marks)
1. **Web Scraping (5 Marks)**
   - Generate a Python script to scrape data from wheeloffortuneanswer.com
   - Save data as "Bukirwa.csv"

2. **Word Visualization (5 Marks)**
   - Generate a visual to depict the "Word To Guess" variable

3. **News Article Analysis (20 Marks)**
   - Create visualizations for European news articles
   - Develop a natural language processing algorithm to classify news articles

## Project Milestones
Each milestone is worth 20 marks of the total project:

1. **Data Exploration and Wrangling**
   - Explore provided datasets using Python notebooks
   - Identify data/variable types
   - Demonstrate data wrangling techniques

2. **Machine Learning Model Development**
   - Generate machine learning models for accurate predictions

3. **Process Mining and Analysis**
   - Analyze event logs
   - Discern processes

4. **Web Scraping for NLP**
   - Run basic web scraping for Natural Language Processing
   - Compile required results

5. **NLP Algorithm Development**
   - Generate key natural language processing algorithms
   - Answer pertinent questions
